        [macOS] [WebGL2] Temporarily upgrade WebGL 2's internal OpenGL context from version 2.1 to 3.2

        In order to test WebGL2 correctly, I had to upgrade the macOS's OpenGL

            Elements should be inserted into a template element as its content's last child
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171373
            <rdar://problem/31862949>

            Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

            Before this change, our HTML parser obeys the following premises:
            1) A fostering child whose parent is a table should be inserted before its parent and under its grandparent.
            2) When inserting into a template element, an element should be inserted into its content.

            Let's walk through the example:
            a) Before eventhandler takes place
            template
            table
                svg <- parser
            b) After eventhandler takes place
            template
                table
                    svg <- parser
            c) after parsing svg
            template
                content
                    svg
                    (table)
                table

            Finally, in the example, the svg element will be inserted into the content of the template element while
            having its next sibling point to the table element. However, the table element is actually under the
            template element not its content.

            This messy tree is constructed because the second premise is incompleted. It should be: When inserting into
            a template element, an element should be inserted into its content as its last child.
            Quoted from Step 3 of https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#appropriate-place-for-inserting-a-node
            A correct tree will then looks like:
            template
                content
                    svg
                table

            Reduce the scope of code that should never dispatch DOM events so as to allow updating contents size

            In r214014 we instantiate a NoEventDispatchAssertion in FrameLoader::commitProvisionalLoad()
            around the call to CachedPage::restore() to assert when a DOM event is dispatched during
            page restoration as such events can cause re-entrancy into the page cache. As it turns out
            it is sufficient to ensure that no DOM events are dispatched after restoring all cached frames
            as opposed to after CachedPage::restore() returns.

            Also rename Document::enqueue{Pageshow, Popstate}Event() to dispatch{Pageshow, Popstate}Event(),
            respectively, since they synchronously dispatch events :(. We hope in the future to make them

            While this assertion is true in theory and as per the specification, it does
            not hold in WebKit when parsing a DocumentFragment. This is because WebKit
            has an optimization causing us to have a DocumentFragment as root element
            when parsing a fragment. See the following constructor:
            "HTMLTreeBuilder(HTMLDocumentParser&, DocumentFragment&, Element&, ParserContentPolicy, const HTMLParserOptions&)"

            """

            m_tree.openElements().pushRootNode(HTMLStackItem::create(fragment));
            """

            Update the assertion to expect a DocumentFragment as root element when parsing

            Time channel attack on SVG Filters

            Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

            The time channel attack can happen if the attacker applies FEColorMatrix
            or FEConvolveMatrix and provides a matrix which is filled with subnormal
            floating point values. Performing floating-point operations on subnormals
            is very expensive unless the pixel in the source graphics is black (or
            zero). By measuring the time a filter takes to be applied, the attacker
            can know whether the pixel he wants to steal from  an iframe is black or
            white. By repeating the same process on all the pixels in the iframe, the
            attacker can reconstruct the whole page of the iframe.

            To fix this issue, the values in the matrices of these filters will clamped
            to FLT_MIN. We do not want to consume too much time calculating filtered
            pixels because of such tiny values. The difference between applying FLT_MIN
            and applying a subnormal should not be even noticeable. Normalizing the
            floating-point matrices should happen only at the beginning of the filter
            platformApplySoftware().

            When adding mask layers, there was an ordering dependency. There was a hack in GraphicsLayerCA::setVisibleAndCoverageRects()
            to propagate m_intersectsCoverageRect to masks. However, if GraphicsLayerCA::setVisibleAndCoverageRects()
            ran on the masked layer before the mask was added, nothing updated the "m_intersectsCoverageRect" state of the mask layer.

            Fix by explicitly calling setVisibleAndCoverageRects() on the mask layer, passing the same rects and
            viewport-constrained state as for its host layer (we already assume that their geometry matches).

            support-click-track-in-panel.html makes that test time out in all test runs. The root of the issue
            is that animations are suspended by media/controls/track-menu.html with a call to
            internals.suspendAnimations(), and that state isn't reset with a call to internals.resumeAnimations().
            Then, media/modern-media-controls/tracks-support/tracks-support-click-track-in-panel.html fails because
            the selection animation for the tracks panel menu item that is clicked never completes and the delegate
            to notify that an item in the tracks panel was selected is never fired, which leads to the test failure.

            We change Internals::suspendAnimations() and Internals::resumeAnimations() to only affect the current
            document, rather than calling into AnimationController::suspendAnimations() which would do just that,

            Follow-up to r211401. When passing around a reference to an object, the assumption is that
            the caller is retaining the underlying object. This breaks down for
            InbandDataTextTrack::removeDataCue(), which releases its own ownership of the cue object,
            then passes the reference to that object to its superclass to do further remove steps. The
            retain count of the cue can thus drop to zero within the scope of
            InbandTextTrack::removeCue(). Use "take" semantics to remove the cue from the
            m_incompleteCueMap without releasing ownership, and pass a reference to that retained object
            on to removeCue(), guaranteeing that the cue will not be destroyed until after the
            romeveDataCue() method returns.

            Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

            This patch brings the implementation of ComplexTextController in-line with the
            design at https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/ComplexTextController. Previously,
            ComplexTextController had a few problems:
            - The total width computed by ComplexTextController didn't match the width if
            you iterated over the entire string and added up the advances
            - FontCascade::getGlyphsAndAdvancesForComplexText() tried to compensate for
            the above by construing the concepts of paint advances as distinct from layout
            advances
            - Initial advances were considered part of layout sometimes and part of painting
            other times, depending on which function reports the information
            - For RTL runs, the wrong origin was added to the initial advance, and the origin
            should have been subtracted instead of added

            This patch exhaustively updates every function in ComplexTextController to be
            consistent with the design linked to above. This design solves all of these
            problems.

            to compute paint advances, which means that it can't base this information off
            of layout advances. This function uses the trick mentioned at the end of the
            above link to compute the paint offset of an arbitrary glyph in the middle of
            an RTL run.
            * platform/graphics/mac/ComplexTextController.cpp:

            (WebCore::ComplexTextController::offsetForPosition): This function operates on
            layout advances, and the initial layout advance is already added into the
            m_adjustedBaseAdvances vector by adjustGlyphsAndAdvances(). Therefore, there is
            no need to add it again here.
            (WebCore::ComplexTextController::advance): This function had completely busted
            logic about the relationship between initial advances and the first origin in
            each run. Because of the fortunate choice of only representing layout advances
            in m_adjustedBaseAdvances, this entire block can be removed and the raw paint
            initial advance can be reported to the GlyphBuffer. Later in the function, we
            have to update the logic about how to compute a paint advance given a layout
            advance and some origins. In particular, there are two tricky pieces here: 1.
            The layout advance for the first glyph is equal to (initial advance - first
            origin + first Core Text advance, so computing the paint offset must cancel out
            the initial layout offset, and 2. the last paint advance in a run must actually
            end up at the position of the first glyph in the next run, so the next run's
            initial advance must be queried.
            (WebCore::ComplexTextController::adjustGlyphsAndAdvances): Previously, we
            represented an initial advance of a successive run by just adding it to the
            previous run's last advance. However, this is incompatible with the new model
            presented in the link above, so we remove this section. We also have to add in
            the logic that the layout advance for the first glyph is equal to the formula
            presented above.

            The jetsams on https://www.buzzfeed.com/anotherround were caused by WebKit creating the backing store

            This was caused by GraphicsLayerCA's setVisibleAndCoverageRects not setting CoverageRectChanged on
            m_uncommittedChanges on the very first call. Fixed the bug by initializing m_uncommittedChanges
            to always have CoverageRectChanged so that the coverage rect would get updated properly.

            Unfortunately, no new tests since somehow the backing store doesn't get created inside the test runner.

            Upon destruction of a Page, we destroy the BackForwardClient, which is supposed
            to keep track of HistoryItems associated to this particular page and remove them
            from the PageCache. Given the crash trace, the issue seems to be that some
            HistoryItems associated with the Page sometimes linger in the PageCache *after*
            the Page has been destroyed, which leads to crashes later on when pruning the
            PageCache.

            In order to make the process more robust, this patch refactors the code so that
            the Page is now in charge of removing all its associated HistoryItems from the
            PageCache instead of relying on the BackForwardClient. Also, instead of having
            the Page keep track of which HistoryItems are associated with it (which is
            error prone), we now scan all PageCache entries instead to find which ones are
            associated with the Page. While this is in theory slower, this is much safer
            and in practice not an issue because the PageCache usually has 3-5 entries.

            Element with a backdrop-filter and a mask may not correctly mask the backdrop

            If a layer had a backdrop filter, but also corner radii that triggered using a mask layer,
            then the call to updateClippingStrategy() in GraphicsLayerCA::updateBackdropFiltersRect() would
            set the backdrop layer's mask, but GraphicsLayerCA::updateMaskLayer() would promptly then set
            the mask layer back to nil.

            Fix by having GraphicsLayerCA::updateMaskLayer() put the mask on the structural layer, if there
            is one. We always have a structural layer with backdrops, so this will mask both the layer
            and the backdrop.

            Crash under DOMSelection::deleteFromDocument()
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167232

            Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

            The crash was caused by DOMSelection's deleteFromDocument() mutating contents inside the user-agent
            shadow tree of an input element when the text field is readonly. Fixed the bug by exiting early
            whenever the selection is inside a shadow tree since getSelection().getRangeAt(0) always returns
            a range outside the input element or any shadow tree for that matter.

            New behavior matches that of Gecko. The working draft spec of which I'm the editor states that
            deleteFromDocument() must invoke Range's deleteContents() on the associated range, which is
            the collapsed range returned by getSelection().getRangeAt(0) in the spec:
            https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-selection-api-20160921/#widl-Selection-deleteFromDocument-void
            And Range's deleteContents() immediately terminates in step 1 when start and end are identical:
            https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/commit-snapshots/6b7621282c2e3b222ac585650e484abf4c0a416b/

            Note that Range's DOM mutating methods are not available inside an user-agent shadow tree because
            WebKit never returns a Range whose end boundary points are inside the tree to author scripts.
            Editing commands (ones executable from document.execCommand) that mutate DOM like this check whether
            the content is editable or not. Since VisibleSelection's validate() function makes sure the selection
            is either entirely within or outside of an root editable element (editing host in the W3C spec lingo),
            editing commands should never mutate a random node inside an user-agent shadow tree.

        Add null checking of the FrameView in Document::destroyRenderTree() before
        calling functions on it. This is not necessary in trunk, as the FrameView
        is guaranteed to be present there.

        FrameView can be missing on the branch, since render trees for page cached documents
        are destroyed when leaving the page cache, not when entering it (trunk behavior.)
        When leaving the page cache, the FrameView is already detached, hence the bug.

            In very specific conditions, a HTMLMediaElement backed by a MediaSource can try to remove

            HTMLMediaElement, and one has not yet been initialized, when the second fails to parse an
            appended buffer after receiving an initialization segment, the HTMLMediaElement will remove
            all its tracks in mediaLoadingFailed(), then MediaSource object itself will attempt remove
            the same track in removeSourceBuffer().

            Solving this the safest way possible: bail early from TrackListBase if asked to remove a
            track which the list does not contain.

            Make sure that we always clean up the DOM window when clearing Window properties, even if the document will
            remain in the page cache. Since 'clearWindowShell' is only used in FrameLoader, divide it's beahvior into
            two steps:
        
            1. Rename 'clearWindowShell' to 'clearWIndowShellsNotMatchingDOMWindow' to better describe its function.
            Switch to a modern C++ loop. Do not switch to the new DOMWindow here, but detach and clear existing
            DOMWindow connections.

            2. Add a new method 'setDOMWindowForWindowShell'. Complete switch to the new DOMWindow.

            This change allows us to disconnect the old DOMWindow, perform the 'setDocument(nullptr)' operation, and then
            connect to the new Window without leaving the loader in an inconsistent state.

            <rdar://problem/28675761>

            Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

            Changeset r200971 added code to ensure that layout is up-to-date before hit testing, but did
            so only for the main frame. It was still possible to enter cross-frame hit testing with a
            subframe needing style recalc. In that situation, the subframe's updateLayout() would get
            called, which could trigger a compositing change that marked the parent frame as needing style
            recalc. A subsequent layout on the parent frame (for example by hit testing traversing into
            a second subframe) could then mutate the parent frame's layer tree while hit testing was
            traversing it.

            This patch modifies the hit test logic to ensure that a recursive layout is performed so that
            we always perform hit tests on a clean set of frames. It also adds some assertions to warn
            us if we encounter this invalid state.

            Reviewed by Darin Adler.

            During the tokenization process of an HTML tag the start and end positions of each of its
            attributes is tracked so that the XSS Auditor can request a snippet around a suspected
            injected attribute. We need to take care to consider document.write() boundaries when
            tracking the start and end positions of each HTML tag and attribute so that the XSS Auditor
            receives the correct snippet. Following r178265 we no longer consider document.write()
            boundaries when tracking the start and end positions of attributes. So, the substring
            represented by the start and end positions of an attribute may correspond to some other
            attribute in the tag. Therefore the XSS Auditor may fail to block an injection because the
            snippet it requested may not be the snippet that it intended to request.

            If a scrolling state tree node changed type (e.g. from sticky to fixed), we'd fail
            to recreate the node so keep a node with the wrong type.

            Fix by destroying the node and making a new one with a new ID in this case. The
            new ID is necessary to ensure that the scrolling tree is updated.

            [MSE][Mac] In SourceBufferPrivateAVFObjC::abort(), support reseting parser to the last appended initialization segment.
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135164

            Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

            Test: media/media-source/media-source-abort-resets-parser.html

            Use the -[AVStreamDataParser appendStreamData:withFlags:] to implement "resetting" the parser. In this case,
            the parser isn't explicitly reset during resetParserState(), but rather a flag is set so that the next append
            signals a data discontinuity, and the parser is reset at that point.

            Because a previous append operation may be in-flight during this abort(), care must be taken to invalidate any
            operations which may have already started on a background thread. So SourceBufferPrivateAVFObjC will use a
            separate WeakPtrFactory for its append operations, will invalidate any outstanding WeakPtrs during an abort(),
            and will block until the previous append() operation completes.

            This will require the WebAVStreamDataParserListener object to occasionally have it's WeakPtr pointing back to the
            SourceBufferPrivateAVFObjC to be reset after an abort(), so make that ivar an @property. Rather than passing a
            RetainPtr to itself in all the callbacks it handles, the WebAVStreamDataParserListener can just pass in a copy
            of its own WeakPtr (which may be invalidated during an abort()).

            Break the distinct operations of "abort()" and "resetParserState()" into their own methods in SourceBufferPrivate
            and all its subclasses.

            Seeking video doesn't update seek position
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162575
            <rdar://problem/28457219>

            Reviewed by Jer Noble.

            On ToT, seeking in a video causes the playhead to stutter, and does not actually update media remote's seek
            position. This is partly due to how we do not update media remote with new information when beginning to respond
            to remote seek commands, so media remote continues to think that a playing video is still playing despite the
            user attempting to seek through it.

            To fix this, we introduce timer-based guards around remote seek commands, such that a seek "gesture" begins when
            we receive the first seek command and ends when no seek command has been received in a set amount of time (this
            is 0.5 seconds, which is approximately what other clients around the platform use).

            Also, when responding to a remote seek, perform the seek with no tolerance. This prevents the playhead from
            stuttering at the end of a seek from the final requested destination of the seek to the last actually seeked
            time in the video.

            When beginning to seek, we must pause the media. Through existing mechanisms, this causes the media session
            manager to update its Now Playing information, which informs media remote that we are no longer playing and
            prevents us from stuttering. However, when ending a seek, we must also trigger an additional update to again
            refresh media remote's view of the current time. This prevents a flicker when playing media after seeking.

            Unit tests to be added in a follow-up due to time constraints.

            Document.cpp previously checked whether a document should inherit its owner's 
            security origin by checking if the URL is either empty or blank. URL.cpp in

            A browsing context can have a creator browsing context, the browsing context 
            that was responsible for its creation. If a browsing context has a parent 
            browsing context, then that is its creator browsing context. Otherwise, if the

            7.1.1 Nested browsing contexts
            Certain elements (for example, iframe elements) can instantiate further 
            browsing contexts. These are called nested browsing contexts. If a browsing 
            context P has a Document D with an element E that nests another browsing 
            context C inside it, then C is said to be nested through D, and E is said to 
            be the browsing context container of C. If the browsing context container 
            element E is in the Document D, then P is said to be the parent browsing 
            context of C and C is said to be a child browsing context of P. Otherwise,

        Reviewed by Geoff Garen.

        All uses of hasStaticPropertyTable flag generated by bindings are wrong.

        JSLocation::putDelegate checks the static property table redundantly.

        In the case of same origin access, if the property is not in the static
        table the method will call JSObject::put and return true (indicating the
        delegate handled the put). If the property is in the static table, the
        method will return false (indicating the the delegate did not handle the
        access) - in which case the calling function will call JSObject::put.
        Checking for the property in the static table is redundant - same origin
        access does not require any special handling, and should just always
        return false & let the caller handle the put.

        In the case of cross origin access, if the property is not in the static
        table we return true (indicating the access was handled, and silently
        blocking it). If it is a static property, we check the name, and if the
        name is not 'href' we also return true, silently blocking. In the case
        that the name is 'href' we'll return false, indicating to the caller
        that the access was not handled by the delegate, resulting in it taking
        place. The additional check of the static table is redundant, since we
        only have special behaviour in the case of 'href'. (Moreover it is
        unnecesszarily fragile, since if we made a change such that 'href' was no
        longer implemented as a static property with would fail.)

        - for same origin, always return false.
        - for cross origin, return false for 'href', otherwise return true.

        ImageDocuments leak their world.

        <rdar://problem/24987363>

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        ImageDocument uses a special code path in ImageLoader in order to manually
        control how the image is loaded. It has to do this because the ImageDocument
        is really just a synthetic wrapper around a main resource that's an image.

        This custom loading code had a bug where it would create a new CachedImage
        and neglect to set its CachedResource::m_state flag to Pending (which is
        normally set by CachedResource::load(), but we don't call that for these.)

        This meant that when ImageDocument called CachedImage::finishLoading() to
        trigger the notifyFinished() callback path, the image would look at its
        loading state and see that it was Unknown (not Pending), and conclude that
        it hadn't loaded yet. So we never got the notifyFinished() signal.

        The world leaks here because ImageLoader slaps a ref on its <img> element
        while it waits for the loading operation to complete. Once finished, whether
        successfully or with an error, it derefs the <img>.

        Since we never fired notifyFinished(), we ended up with an extra ref on
        these <img> forever, and then the element kept its document alive too.

        In an effort to reduce the flash of unstyled content, we force all elements
        to have display: none during an external stylesheet load. We do this by
        ignoring the CSS cascade and forcing all elements to have a placeholder style
        which hardcodes display: none. (This is necessary to make elements created by
        script during the stylesheet load not flash.)

        This style is exposed to web content via getComputedStyle(), which means it
        needs to maintain the invariant that font-families can never be null strings.

        We already had most of the infrastructure for dotted / dashed underlines.
        Previously, we were setting the stroke style for the underlines, but then

        Instead, we should just compute the individual dots / dashes to fill.

        The implementation of this is done inside GraphicsContext because
        GraphicsContext is already responsible for handling the single / double

            Garbage is displayed when root svg element has mix-blend-mode set
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=150556

            Reviewed by Darin Adler.

            This bug happens when compositing on a CALayer and drawing on a transparent
            layer, so it happens with WK2 with <svg style="mix-blend-mode...">. And it
            can happen with WK1 also with <svg style="opacity=...;mix-blend-mode...">.
            But in both cases, the SVG root renderer should be the root of the render
            tree. So it happens only with the stand alone SVG documents.

            SVGRenderContext::prepareToRenderSVGContent() ignores the opacity of
            the SVG root but it creates a transparent layer for the blend-mode.

            But RenderLayer::beginTransparencyLayers() creates a transparent layer
            for opacity and it sets the blend-mode also.

            The fix is to begin two transparent layers for the SVG root renderer: one
            for the opacity and the second for the blend-mode. The opacity transparent
            layer will be still managed by RenderLayer::beginTransparencyLayers(). While
            the blend-mode transparent layer will be managed by SVGRenderContext
            ::prepareToRenderSVGContent().

            Crash under FormSubmission::create()

            <rdar://problem/30096323>

            Reviewed by Darin Adler.

            The issue is that FormSubmission::create() was iterating over
            form.associatedElements() as was calling Element::appendFormData()
            in the loop. HTMLObjectElement::appendFormData() was calling
            pluginWidget(PluginLoadingPolicy::Load) which causes a synchronous
            layout and can fire events (such as focus event) synchronously.
            Firing those events synchronously allows the JS to modify the
            form.associatedElements() vector we are currently iterating on.

            To avoid this issue, we now call pluginWidget(PluginLoadingPolicy::DoNotLoad)
            in HTMLObjectElement::appendFormData() as we are not allowed to fire
            synchronous events at this point. I also added a security assertion
            in FormSubmission::create() to catch cases where we fire JS events
            while iterating over the form associated elements to more easily
            notice these things in the future.

            This patch ensures that we always have a block level container for media controls
            so that continuation never needs to split RenderMedia into multiple subtrees.

            Current inline continuation logic assumes that only inline elements with RenderInline
            type of renderers participate in continuation. This is mostly the case since other inline renderers
            such as RenderReplaced, RenderImage, RenderEmbeddedObject etc can't have (accessible) children.

            [OS X] Remove support for composite fonts

            Reviewed by Dan Bernstein.

            Composite fonts were first introduced in [1]. These composite fonts are extremely rare
            because:
            1. None of the preinstalled fonts on either OS X nor iOS are composite fonts,
            2. WebKit does not support loading web fonts from composite font files, and
            3. WebKit's support only ever existed on OS X (none of the other ports).

            In fact, no one I've consulted with has ever seen any of these fonts used in the wild.
            The fonts also require a fundamentally broken code path, and add complexity to WebKit.

            Re-enable synchronous popstate event for safari-601-branch
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153297
            rdar://problem/24154417

            Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

            r192369 made the popstate event dispatch asynchronously, which matches what the HTML5 spec says to do.
            However, due to compatibility regressions, we do not want to include this behavior change in
            safari-601-branch. This change reverts r192369's changes to Document.cpp, but retains the new tests.
            This change is intended only for safari-601-branch and its copies. The popstate event should remain
            asynchronous in trunk.

            Firing popstate synchronously makes both fast/loader/remove-iframe-during-history-navigation-different.
            Html and fast/loader/remove-iframe-during-history-navigation-same.html crash, because their onpopstate
            handlers remove frames from the document that will later be accessed by
            HistoryController::recursiveGoToItem().

            To prevent the crashes, this change does two things:
            1. Keep a reference to the current frame inside FrameLoader::loadSameDocumentItem(), since calling
               loadInSameDocument() might otherwise delete it.
            2. Handle a null frame when iterating a HistoryItem's child frames in
               HistoryController::recursiveGoToItem(), since calling goToItem() on one frame might cause another
               frame to be deleted.

            Covered by existing tests. fast/loader/stateobjects/popstate-is-asynchronous-expected.txt was updated
            to expect popstate to be synchronous.

            GlyphPage::fill() has multiple code paths to accomplish its goal. It uses the shouldUseCoreText() helper
            function to determine which one of the paths should be taken. However, not all of the code paths in
            GlyphPage::fill() are able of handling all situations. Indeed, the CoreText code paths in GlyphPage::fill()
            are only able to handle the situations which shouldUseCoreText() returns true for. This happens in the
            following cases:

            1. If the font is a composite font
            2. If the font is used for text-combine
            3. If the font has vertical glyphs

            In r187693, I added one more case to this list: If the font is the system font. However, I failed to add
            the necessary support to GlyphPage::fill() for this case. Becasue of this, we just happened to fall into
            the case of vertical fonts (just by coincidence), which causes us to use
            CTFontGetVerticalGlyphsForCharacters() instead of CTFontGetGlyphsForCharacters().

            The solution is to adopt the same behavior we were using before r187693. Back then, we were using
            CGFontGetGlyphsForUnichars(), which always returned horizontal glyphs. We should simply adopt this same
            behavior, except in the Core Text case. Therefore, this patch is just a simple check to see if we are
            using the system font when determining which Core Text function to use.

            In order to perform font fallback, we must know which fonts support which characters. We
            perform this check by asking each font to map a sequence of codepoints to glyphs, and
            any glyphs which end up with a 0 value are unsupported by the font.

            One of the mechanisms that we use to do this is to combine the code points into a string,
            and tell Core Text to lay out the string. However, this is fundamentally a different
            operation than the one we are trying to perform. Strings combine adjacent codepoints into
            grapheme clusters, and CoreText operates on these. However, we are trying to gain
            information regarding codepoints, not grapheme clusters.

            Instead of taking this string-based approach, we should try harder to use Core Text
            functions which operate on ordered collections of characters, rather than strings. In
            particular, CTFontGetGlyphsForCharacters() and CTFontGetVerticalGlyphsForCharacters()
            have the behavior we want where any unmapped characters end up with a 0 value glyph.

            Previously, we were only using the result of those functions if they were successfully
            able to map their entire input. However, given the fact that we can degrade gracefully
            in the case of a partial mapping, we shouldn't need to bail completely to the
            string-based approach should a partial mapping occur.

            At some point we should delete the string-based approach entirely. However, this path
            is still explicitly used for composite fonts. Fixing that use case is out of scope
            for this patch.

                Test: http/tests/inspector/console/cross-domain-inspected-node-access.html

                The inspector backend injects the CommandLineAPI Source with a
                corresponding CommandLineAPIHost into each execution context
                created by the page (main frame, sub frames, etc).

                When creating the JSValue wrapper for the CommandLineAPIHost using
                the generated toJS(...) DOM bindings, we were using the cached
                CommandLineAPIHost wrapper values in the single DOMWrapperWorld shared
                across all frames. This meant that the first time the wrapper was
                needed it was created in context A. But when needed for context B
                it was using the wrapper created in context A. Using this wrapper
                in context B was producing unexpected cross-origin warnings.

                The solution taken here, is to create a new JSValue wrapper for
                the CommandLineAPIHost per execution context. This way each time
                the CommandLineAPIHost wrapper is used in a frame, it is using
                the one created for that frame.

                The C++ host object being wrapped has a lifetime equivalent to
                the Page. It does not change in this patch. The wrapper values
                are cleared on page navigation or when the page is closed, and
                will be garbage collected.

            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152541
            rdar://problem/23886181

            Reviewed by Tim Horton.

            r154382 added code that modifies parentLayer traversal, looking for ancestor
            scrollable layers. However, it confusingly added another code path in which
            the ancestor layer traversal cross a frame boundary, when RenderLayer::scrollRectToVisible()
            already has one. I fixed this new location to adjust the rect coordinates in r187593,
            but then code that hit both crossing points double-mapped the coordinates, causing
            autoscroll jumping.

            Fix by reverting r154382 and r187593, going back to doing the ancestor walk in
            one place. Re-fix r154382 by implementing RenderLayer::allowsCurrentScroll(),
            which contains the logic for line clamp, autoscroll and ensuring that overflow:hidden
            can be programmatically scrolled.

            Form controls are special; they can have overflow:hidden but still be user-scrollable
            during autoscroll; this is handled via the confusingly-named canBeProgramaticallyScrolled().
            RenderTextControlSingleLine implements this to ensure that readonly text inputs
            autoscroll (which is exercised by a test).

            The frame-to-parent-frame rect mapping in RenderLayer::scrollRectToVisible() is
            fixed to use the coordinate mapping functions from Widget/ScrollView, with the
            addition of a new utility function contentsToContainingViewContents().

            A "Scrolling" logging channel is added with a few log points.

            When using a font feature that is synthesizable, and synthesis is triggered,

            font-variant-caps does not work if the font does not support font features

            Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

            This test implements synthesis for small-caps and all-small-caps. It does so by
            moving font variant selection into a higher level (ComplexTextController).
            In general, the approach is to use the pure font feature until we encounter
            a character which needs to be uppercased, and which the font feature does not
            support uppercasing. In this situation, we try again with synthesis. In this
            case, synthesis means artificially uppercasing letters and rendering them with
            a smaller font.

            We require system support to know which glyphs a particular font feature supports.
            Therefore, on operating systems which do not include this support, we will simply
            say that the font feature does not support any glyphs.

                Following "stretch" and "repeat", the code is added to Image::drawTiled().

                For "round", we compute an integral number of copies of the image that fit,
                and then adjust the tile scale.

                For "space", we also compute an integral number N of copies that will fit,
                and then divide the remaining space amongst N+1 gaps, adjusting the tiling
                phase so that with an even number of images, a gap is centered.

            Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

            When the main resource of a media document commits, WebKit cancels its load since the plug-in or media engine
            will do its own loading. If content filtering is enabled, and the filter waits allow the load until the entire
            resource is downloaded, then ContentFilter will attempt to call DocumentLoader::notifyFinished() immediately
            after delivering the buffered resource data to DocumentLoader. However, delivering the data will have nulled out
            DocumentLoader's m_mainResource when the load was cancelled, leading to a crash in notifyFinished().

            To resolve this, add a new Stopped state to ContentFilter. Set this state if DocumentLoader clears its main
            resource or detaches from its frame. If ContentFilter is in the Stopped state after calling
            DocumentLoader::dataReceived(), do not proceed to call DocumentLoader::notifyFinished().

            Don't fire popstate event on initial document load

            According to the specification [1], a popstate event should only be fired
            when the document has a "last entry" and the entry being navigated to isn't
            it.  A document is created without a "last entry" and gets one just after
            this check when it is first navigated to, so a popstate should be fired any
            time a document is navigated to except for the first time after it has been
            created.

            Exploitable crash happens when an SVG contains an indirect resource inheritance cycle
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=150203

            Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

            Detecting cycles in SVG resource references happens in two places.
            1. In SVGResourcesCycleSolver::resolveCycles() which it is called from 
               SVGResourcesCache::addResourcesFromRenderer(). When a cycle is deleted,
               SVGResourcesCycleSolver::breakCycle() is called to break the link. In
               the case of a cyclic resource inheritance, SVGResources::resetLinkedResource()
               is called to break this cycle.
            2. SVGPatternElement::collectPatternAttributes() which is called from
               RenderSVGResourcePattern::buildPattern(). The purpose is to resolve
               the pattern attributes and to build a tile image which can be used to
               fill the SVG element renderer. Detecting the cyclic resource reference
               in this function is not sufficient and can detect simple cycles like
                <pattern id="a" xlink:href="#b"/>
                <pattern id="b" xlink:href="#a"/>.
               But it does not detect cycles like:
                <pattern id="a">
                    <rect fill="url(#b)"/>
                </pattern>
                <pattern id="b" xlink:href="#a"/>.

            The fix is to get rid of SVGPatternElement::collectPatternAttributes() which
            uses SVGURIReference::targetElementFromIRIString() to navigates through the
            referenced resource elements and tries to detect cycles. Instead we can
            implement RenderSVGResourcePattern::collectPatternAttributes() which calls
            SVGResourcesCache::cachedResourcesForRenderer() to get the SVGResources
            of the pattern. Then we use SVGResources::linkedResource() to navigate the
            resource inheritance tree. The cached SVGResources is guaranteed to be free
            of cycles.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This user default is currently on by default. Therefore, by setting the user default,
        users can only disable kerning / ligatures (rather than enable it).

        There are a few reasons why we should stop honoring it:

        1. In the brave new world of font-feature-settings and font-variant-ligatures, there
        are many different kinds of ligatures which may be enabled at will. The simplistic
        statement of "turn on ligatures" no longer has any meaning.

        2. If a user wants to disable kerning / ligatures, he/she can do it with a user
        stylesheet.

        3. The default isn't able to be tested with DumpRenderTree or WebKitTestRunner.

        4. I have never heard of anyone actually using this user default.

        FontCascade::typesettingFeatures() is not privy to font-variant-* nor font-feature-settings
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149775

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch has two pieces:

        We used to have a boolean, enableLigatures, which affected how we perform shaping in both our
        simple and complex text codepaths. However, in this brave new world of font-feature-settings
        and font-variant-*, there are many properties which may affect shaping (and multiple kinds
        of ligatures). This patch renames this boolean to requiresShaping, and teaches it about all
        the various properties which affect text shaping.

        Similarly, one of the places which used this enableLigatures boolean was to tell CoreText
        if it should disable ligatures. However, we now have much finer-grained control over
        ligatures during font creation. This patch moves the responsibility of dictating which
        font features should be enabled entirely to the Font. Therefore, getCFStringAttributes()
        doesn't know anything about ligatures anymore; the logic inside font creation is used
        instead.

        An added benefit of moving all the font feature logic to one place is that we can implement
        the feature resolution algorithm described in the CSS3 fonts spec. This patch adds a test to
        makes sure that text-rendering, font-feature-settings, and font-variant-* play together
        nicely.

        Split TypesettingFeatures into kerning and ligatures bools
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=150074

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Our TypesettingFeatures type represents whether kerning or ligatures are enabled
        when laying out text. However, now that I have implemented font-feature-settings
        and font-variant-*, this type is wildly inadequate. There are now multiple kinds
        of ligatures, and many other features which are neither kerning nor ligatures.
        Adding tons of information to this type doesn't make sense because 1) We already
        have a FontVariantSettings struct which contains this information, and 2) None
        of the users of TypesettingFeatures care about most of these new features.

        In this new world of font features, the font-kerning property isn't changing.
        Therefore, all the code which relies only on the Kerning value in
        TypesettingFeatures doesn't need to change. The places which rely on Ligatures,
        however, need to be updated to understand that there are many different kinds
        of ligatures.

        Indeed, after inspection, all of the places which inspect ligatures are more
        interested in a high-level concept of whether or not we can trust some simple
        computation. Therefore, we really have two things we care about: Kerning, and
        this high-level concept.

        This patch is the second step to update our view of the world to include
        font-feature-settings and font-variant-*. In particular, this patch simply
        splits TypesettingFeatures into two Booleans, one for Kerning, and one for
        Ligatures (which has no behavior change). Then, once they are separated, I can
        migrate the Ligatures Boolean to take on its new meaning.

        This change is purely mechanical.

        No new tests because there is no behavior change.

        <rdar://problem/22392235>

        Reviewed by David Kilzer.

        MemoryCache::pruneDeadResourcesToSize() is iterating over m_allResources
        (which is a vector of LRUList). It first destroys decoded data for each
        resource in the LRUList. Then, if it does not suffice to reach the
        target size, and starts actually removing resources from the cache.

        The issue is that this code alters m_allResources (and its LRULists) as
        it is iterating over it. We tried to deal with this in various ways:
        1. Increment the iterator before removing the resource pointed by the
          iterator.
        2. Protect the next resource in the LRUList and abort early if it is no
          longer in the cache.

        This adds code complexity and apparently does not correctly handle all
        the edge cases as we still see crashes in this code. In particular, I
        suspect that 2. may not be sufficient if it is possible for the next
        resource to be moved to another LRUList (in which case, next->inCache()
        would still return true but the iterator would however become invalid).

        To make the code simpler and more robust, this patch copies the LRUList
        (and refs the CachedResources) before iterating over it. This is a lot
        safer and should hopefully fix the crashes we see in this function.

        No new tests, no reproduction case.

            Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

            CSSSegmentedFontFace::fontRanges() was trying to hash on FontDescriptors by
            picking a few specific pieces of data out of the FontDescriptor, computing
            a hash on it, and using that unsigned as a key in a HashMap. This has two
            problems: it doesn't handle equality correctly, as hash collisions cannot
            depend on an equality operator to dedup, and it doesn't hash on all the
            members of a FontDescription.

            Instead, this HashMap should use FontDescriptionKey, which represents a
            FontDescription, and is designed exactly for the purpose of being used as a
            key in a HashMap.

        [Cocoa] [Font Features] Implement font-variant-*
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148413

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch is the first pass of implementing of the font-variant-* properties. Specifically,
        these properties are:
        font-variant-ligatures
        font-variant-position
        font-variant-caps
        font-variant-numeric
        font-variant-alternates
        font-variant-east-asian

        These new properties are held inside FontDescription as bit fields. At font creation time,
        we consult with the FontDescription to figure out which variants are specified. We then
        convert those variants to font features, and resolve these font features with the additional
        features specified by font-feature-settings (as the spec requires). This patch also makes
        our caches sensitive to these new properties of FontDescription so we don't look up cached,
        stale fonts.

        The implementation has some caveats, however. They are listed here:
        1. These new properties need to interact correctly with @font-face declarations. In
        particular, only certain properties of the FontDescription should be considered when
        detecting if a @font-face declaration applies to a particular element. This discrimination
        does not happen correctly. In addition, any feature-specific CSS properties inside the
        @font-face declaration need to be consulted at a particular point during the feature
        resolve. This does not currently occur.
        2. One of the properties, font-variant-alternates, has a few values which require custom
        CSS functions, which makes modeling the properties as bit fields tricky. These extra values
        need to be implemented. This patch implements all the values which do not require extra CSS
        features.
        3. These new properties have a shorthand, font-variant, which is designed to be backward-
        compatible with CSS 2.1's concept of font-variant. In particular, CSS 2.1 allows you to use
        "normal" and "small-caps" with font-variant. Both of these values are values of the new
        property font-variant-caps. However, our existing implementation of small-caps does not
        use font features when they exist; instead, it simply draws text at a smaller font size and
        uses (effectively) text-transform to force capital letters. This implementation needs to be
        unified with the new font-variant-caps property so that we can expand font-variant to be
        a shorthand for the new properties.
        4. font-variant-position and font-variant-caps should provide appropriate synthesis if no
        matching font-feature exists.
        5. FontCascade::typesettingFeatures() is now no-longer accurate. Fixing this would be large
        enough to warrant its own patch.
        6. These properties are not tested with TrueType fonts.

        FontDescriptionKey is designed to encapsulate all the cacheable properties of a FontDescription.
        However, a higher-level cache, FontCascadeCacheKey, was taking some values from FontDescriptions.
        The fact that there wasn't a bug before is just a happy coincidence. This patch moves those bits

        Just like how FontDescription hashes should be sensitive to locale, they should

        This patch also fixes operator== for FontDescriptionKey, which was previously
        comparing hashes for equality instead of the underlying data. Comparing hashes
        for equality is useless inside hashmaps.

        This is in preparation for implementing font-feature-settings.

            At the parser level, "revert" is just like inherit/initial/unset and gets its own special

            * css/FontLoader.cpp:

            * css/SelectorChecker.h:
            Add a MatchDefault value of 0 to the LinkMatchMask. This enables it to be used as an index
            to the correct value in Property (in the style resolution code).

            (WebCore::StyleResolver::applyMatchedProperties):
            Pass along the MatchResult as an additional parameter, since we need it to lazily compute
            the cascade rollbacks if the "revert" keyword is encountered.

            (WebCore::StyleResolver::cascadedPropertiesForRollback):
            This method will lazily create and return a new CascadedProperties pointer that is cached
            in the StyleResolver's state. This will contain only UA rules (for user reverts) and UA/user
            rules (for author reverts). These will only be computed at most once for a given element
            when doing a reversion, and they will be computed lazily, i.e., only if a revert is
            requested.

            (WebCore::StyleResolver::applyProperty):
            Pass along the LinkMatchMask and the MatchResult to applyProperty. This way we know specifically
            which link type we were computing if we have to revert (so that we roll back and look at the
            same index in the reverted version). The MatchResult is passed along because it is needed
            to build the CascadedProperties rollbacks.

            The basic idea is that if a revert is encountered, the level that the rule came from is
            checked. If it is UA level, just treat as "unset." If it is author or user level, get
            the correct CascadedProperties rollback and repeat the applyProperty using the property
            found in the rollback. If the property is not present in the cascade rollback, then the
            revert becomes an unset.

            (WebCore::StyleResolver::CascadedProperties::customProperty):
            Helpers used by applyProperty to check on custom properties, since they can revert too

            Passing along the CascadeLevel (UA, User, Author) so that it can be stored in the Property.
            This way when we do property application, we always know where the rule came from so
            that the reversion can be handled properly.

            feature information is contained within FontDescription, and our
            caches are correctly sensitive to this information. Therefore,
            we just need to make our font lookup code honor the request to
            use certain features.

            This patch creates a file, FontCacheCoreText.cpp, which will be the
            new home of all shared OS X / iOS FontCache code. Over time, I will

            This patch rolls r187707 back in which was rolled out in r187802 due to test flakiness. This patch
            fixes the flakiness.

            No new tests because there is no behavior change.

            (WebCore::CSSCustomPropertyValue::value):
            (WebCore::CSSCustomPropertyValue::CSSCustomPropertyValue):
            The CSSCustomPropertyValue represents a custom property/value pair in the back end. It holds on
            to both the property name and a CSSValueList that has the original parser terms. This class also
            doubles as the invalid-at-compute-time value for custom properties when they contain cycles, etc.

            Hands back a CSSParserValue for a function with variables replaced with their real values (or fallback).

            * css/CSSGrammar.y.in:
            Many changes to support the var() syntax and to handle error conditions and cases.

            * css/CSSParser.cpp:
            (WebCore::filterProperties):
            Null check the value here. Shouldn't happen, but being paranoid.

            (WebCore::CSSParser::parseVariableDependentValue):
            This function converts a CSSValueList back into a CSSParserValueList and then passes
            it off to the parser. If the result parses, successfully, then the parsed CSSValue is handed back.

            (WebCore::CSSParser::parseValue):
            Detect when a property value contains variables and simply make a CSSVariableDependentValue to hold
            a copy of the parser value list (as a CSSValueList). We defer parsing the list until compute-time
            when we know the values of the variables to use.

            (WebCore::CSSParser::parseCustomPropertyDeclaration):
            Add support for inherit, initial and variable references in custom properties.

            (WebCore::CSSParser::detectFunctionTypeToken):

            Fix the parsing of custom properties to allow "--" and to allow them to start with digits, e.g., "--0".

            * css/CSSParser.h:
            Add parseVariableDependentValue function for handling variable substitution and subsequent parsing
            of the resolved parser value list.

            * css/CSSParserValues.cpp:
            (WebCore::CSSParserValueList::containsVariables):
            Get rid of the toString() function (no longer needed) and replace it with containsVariables(). This
            check is used to figure out if a parser value list has variables and thus needs to defer parsing
            until later.

            (WebCore::CSSParserValue::createCSSValue):
            Add support for the creation of values for variables, CSSVariableValues.

            (WebCore::CSSParserValueList::toString): Deleted.
            No longer needed.

            * css/CSSParserValues.h:
            Add CSSParserVariable as a new kind of parser value. This represents a var() that is encountered
            during parsing. It is similar to a function except it has to hold both the reference (custom property name)
            and fallback arguments.

            Add support for CSS_PARSER_WHITESPACE as a way of preserving whitespace as a parsed item (variables can
            be only whitespace, and this has to be retained).

            (WebCore::CSSPrimitiveValue::buildParserValue):
            Conversion from a CSSPrimitiveValue back into a parser value is handled by this function.

            (WebCore::CSSVariableDependentValue::CSSVariableDependentValue):
            This value represents a list of terms that have not had variables substituted yet. The list
            is held by the value so that it can be converted back into a parser value list once the
            variable values are known.

            (WebCore::CSSVariableValue::CSSVariableValue):

            This value represents a var() itself. It knows how to do the substitution of the variable
            value and to apply fallback if that value is not present.

            Patched to factor property fetching into an internal method so that variables can work with shorthands
            in the CSS OM.

            * css/StyleResolver.cpp:
            (WebCore::StyleResolver::applyProperty):
            Resolve variable values at compute time. If they fail to resolve, use inherit or initial as the
            value (depending on whether the property inherits by default).

            (WebCore::StyleResolver::resolvedVariableValue):
            Helper function that calls parseVariableDependentValue and gets the resolved result.

            (WebCore::StyleResolver::applyCascadedProperties):
            After custom properties have been collected, we check for cycles and perform variable substitutions.
            This way we get all the variables replaced before we inherit down the style tree.

            Add resolvedVariableValue declaration.

            * css/makeprop.pl:

            * rendering/style/RenderStyle.cpp:
            (WebCore::RenderStyle::checkVariablesInCustomProperties):
            This function handles updating variables with cycles to be invalid in the RenderStyle. It then also
            handles the replacement of variables found in custom properties with resolved values. All custom

            completes.

            where
                <animateable-feature> = scroll-position | contents | <custom-ident>

            To support this, add WillChangeData which stores a vector of "feature"
            and CSS property squished into 16 bits. This is stored in rareNonInheritedData.
            If null or an empty list, the property value is 'auto'. The list preserves
            unknown properties.

            Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

            CodeMirror maintains its own editor buffer and implements its own
            `killLine` command but doesn't implement the yank command. So, text
            that is "killed" with CTRL-k inside a CodeMirror instance isn't
            added to Editor's kill ring. Subsequent yank commands won't match
            up with the killed text, instead returning text from a prior kill
            that was handled by Editor (i.e., in a contenteditable or form input).

            This patch adds a host function so that the Inspector frontend can
            append "missed" killed text to Editor's kill ring. Subsequent
            yanks handled by Editor will then match the text killed by CodeMirror.

            No new tests, because we need to use both InspectorFrontendHost
            and TestRunner.execCommand, but the latter is not available in
            the inspector context where we would need to simulate a kill.

            Over 11 years ago, someone was in a big hurry to fix a bunch

            behavior for backwards-delete-word. It should prepend to the beginning.

            This patch fixes the regression and cleans up the kill ring-related
            code in Editor and commands. It also adds some tests to cover the
            regressed code a bit better.

            On a large page with a wheel event handler on the body, we would call
            Element::absoluteEventHandlerBounds() for every element under the body,
            and compute an absolute bounds for each one. This is very slow.

            For now, optimize computing a region for the <body> by just using the document
            bounds, which will always be as big or larger. It's OK for this region to
            be an overestimate.

            Since the tree scope is set to that of Document's inside removeBetween when a node is removed from a shadow tree,

            Crash when font completes downloading after calling 2D canvas setText() multiple times
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148789

            Reviewed by Darin Adler.

            The CSSFontSelector has a list of clients, and when fonts complete downloading, these
            clients get a call back. CanvasRenderingContext2D::State is one such of these clients. However,
            the CSSFontSelector may be destroyed and recreated at any time. We were getting into a case
            where multiple CSSFontSelectors were thinking that the same CanvasRenderingContext2D::State were
            their client. When the CanvasRenderingContext2D::State was destroyed, it only unregistered
            itself from one of the CSSFontSelectors, which means the CSSFontSelector left over has a dangling
            pointer to it.

            The solution is to implement a new helper class, FontProxy, to hold the
            CanvasRenderingContext2D::State's font, and maintain the invariant that this object is always
            registered to exactly one CSSFontSelector, and this CSSFontSelector is the one which is associated
            with the FontProxy's FontCascade object. This patch maintains this invariant, as well as protecting
            all access to the State's FontCascade object so no one can reach in and change it without going
            through functions which maintain the invariant.

            The "Charset Index" in OTF are indices into a collection of strings. There are
            390 predefined strings in this collection. We were currently assigning each
            glyph to one of these strings. However, if there are more glyphs than strings,
            we will be using invalid indices.

            The values of the strings themselves are not necessary for SVG fonts. Therefore,
            the solution is to create a single dummy string, and have all glyphs target it.

            [Content Filtering] Determine navigation and content policy before continuing to filter a load
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148506

            Reviewed by Brady Eidson.

            Prior to this change, ContentFilter would hide from DocumentLoader all CachedRawResourceClient callbacks until
            a decision was made, then replay the missed callbacks. This approach interacted poorly with some features of
            the loader, notably appcache and downloads. In the case of appcache, DocumentLoader might not have a chance to
            check for substitute data until the original load has finished, wasting bandwidth, and might receive duplicate
            or out-of-order callbacks. In the case of downloads, it would often be too late to convert the existing
            connection to a download, leading to restarted downloads or outright failures.

            Bandaids were put in place for these issues in r188150, r188486, and r188851 to fix crashes or serious
            regressions in behavior, but these weren't complete fixes. They did not solve any of the duplicate data loading
            problems, and they did not make downloads work reliably in all cases.

            This patch rolls out the bandaids (but keeps their tests) and replaces them with a more robust fix. Instead of
            hiding callbacks from DocumentLoader, ContentFilter now delivers willSendRequest(), redirectReceived(), and
            responseReceived() to DocumentLoader immediately, and cancels filtering if DocumentLoader decides to ignore the
            load, download it, or load substitute data. ContentFilter continues to buffer incoming data to prevent partial
            rendering of blocked content.

            The existing tests for r188150 and r188851 were kept, the test for r188486 was rewritten to be specific to
            content filtering, and new tests were added to cover the case where ContentFilter is still undecided after a
            load finishes.

            Unfortunately we can't test automatically because it

            Some Websites (e.g. www.popehat.com) also wrongly return Epoch as

            [Cocoa] Punctuation near Hindi text is garbled when styled with the system font
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148164

            Reviewed by Brian Burg.

            Fonts cache whether or not they are the system font. This caching took place at the end of Font::platformInit().
            However, in the middle of Font::platformInit(), we look up a glyph, which calls GlyphPage::fill() which consults
            with this cache. However, at this point, the cache has not been constructed yet. The solution is just to
            construct the cache earlier (at the beginning of the function).

            Consulting with the cache before it is populated causes it to erroneously say that no fonts are system fonts.
            Then, we use Core Graphics to ask for glyphs instead of Core Text. Core Graphics, however, is incapable of
            handling the system font, and returns us garbled results. In particular, when the system language is set to
            Japanese, the system font does not support punctuation, and Core Text tells us so. However, Core Graphics
            erroneously tells us that the system font does support punctuation.

            Then, if text is near the punctuation which causes us to take the complex text codepath (such as Hindi text),
            we tell Core Text to explicitly lay out the punctuation using the system font (which does not support
            punctuation). Core Text then replies that the provided font doesn't support the punctuation, and that we should
            use LastResort with some other glyphs instead. WebKit then disregards the font CoreText told us to use (because
            we are oh-so-sure that the font in question supports punctuation) and uses the LastResort glyph IDs with our
            font, which causes arbitrary glyphs to be shown.

            We cache the current viewport renderer (FrameView::m_viewportRenderer) right before layout.
            It gets dereferenced later when layout is finished to update the overflow status.
            If the viewport renderer gets destroyed during layout, we end up with a dangling pointer.
            This patch replaces the pointer caching with type caching (none, body, document).

            A renderer should never be assigned to multiple selection subtrees. (Currently RenderObject maintains the last selection state.)
            RenderView::applySubtreeSelection() loops from the start to the end of the selection to find renderers that are inside the selection.
            However, in case of regions (when multiple selection roots are present) traversing the renderer tree by calling RenderObject::nextInPreOrder() could
            end up going across selection roots.
            This patch ensures that we assign renderers to a specific selection only when the current selection root and the renderer's selection root match.

            When two seekWithTolerance() requests come in before the first is acted upon in seekTask(),
            the second will result in a "no seek required" conditional, because the new "currentTime" is

            When cancelling a pending seek, first replace the "now" value with the "now" value from the

            Applying CSS display styles to tables can end up inserting anonymous RenderTableRows, which is not handled well by the

            and finding the real rows and cells we want. In addition, another thing also causing malformed tables is that "grid"

            In order to perform font fallback, we must know which fonts support which characters. We
            perform this check by asking each font to map a sequence of codepoints to glyphs, and
            any glyphs which end up with a 0 value are unsupported by the font.

            One of the mechanisms that we use to do this is to combine the code points into a string,
            and tell Core Text to lay out the string. However, this is fundamentally a different
            operation than the one we are trying to perform. Strings combine adjacent codepoints into
            grapheme clusters, and CoreText operates on these. However, we are trying to gain
            information regarding codepoints, not grapheme clusters.

            Instead of taking this string-based approach, we should try harder to use Core Text
            functions which operate on ordered collections of characters, rather than strings. In
            particular, CTFontGetGlyphsForCharacters() and CTFontGetVerticalGlyphsForCharacters()
            have the behavior we want where any unmapped characters end up with a 0 value glyph.

            Previously, we were only using the result of those functions if they were successfully
            able to map their entire input. However, given the fact that we can degrade gracefully
            in the case of a partial mapping, we shouldn't need to bail completely to the
            string-based approach should a partial mapping occur.

            At some point we should delete the string-based approach entirely. However, this path
            is still explicitly used for composite fonts. Fixing that use case is out of scope
            for this patch.

            When we are wrapping up processing of the wheel event for a given frame, if the current latching context
            does NOT apply to the current frame (e.g., because it's latched to an enclosing frame) we should not pass
            wheel events directly to the latched elements scrollable container. Instead, we should just give the current
            frame an opportunity to perform any custom wheel event handling and return, so that the enclosing (latched)
            frame can do the rest of its event handling.

            If we don't do this, we incorrectly ask the enclosing frame to process the event, then return claiming that
            we handled the event, preventing the enclosing frame from doing its part of the processing.

            When an accelerated animation or transition was started at the same time as
            a non-accelerated one, and then the node for the former was removed, we could
            never kick off the non-accelerated animation.

            AnimationControllerPrivate has logic to synchronize the two types of animation
            when they start in the same animation update, which involves setting the
            m_waitingForAsyncStartNotification flag, and waiting for a notifyAnimationStarted()
            to come in from the graphics system.

            However, it failed to handle the case where the accelerated animation was removed
            before the callback was received, which left the m_waitingForAsyncStartNotification flag
            set to true, preventing the non-accelerated animation from running.

            [iOS] Crash when encountering characters whose natural font is one we can't look up

            These characters hit the complex text code path, where CoreText picks fonts
            to use for each character. We then try to map these CoreText fonts back to
            our own Font objects, and we assume (on iOS) that our own font search will
            always return something.

            On OS X, we do not have such an assumption, and we handle the case where it
            does not hold. This method works on iOS as well, so the solution is to just
            perform it on both OSes.

            rdar://problem/21429111

            Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

            Blurry inline video controls are the result of transform scaling up the content when the page
            is zoomed out (page scale > 1).
            This patch addresses the blurriness by switching to css zoom when the content is being scaled up.
            While transform scale is a paint time operation, css zoom triggers layout and the content is getting
            painted on a non-scaled graphics context.

            Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

            Overlap testing for compositing uses the currently laid out position of fixed
            elements, without taking into account the fact that async scrolling can move
            them around, and possibly under other non-composited elements. This manifested
            as position:fixed elements moving over other elements on some pages when
            scrolling, when they should have moved behind.

            Fix by expanding the overlap map entry for position:fixed elements to create
            an rect for the area they cover at all scroll locations, taking min and max
            scroll offsets into account.

            Also add a couple more LOG(Compositing) statements.

            StyleSheetContents::wrapperInsertRule() can create rules that overflow RuleData's selector index
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147144

            Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

            RuleData identifies selectors by the index in a large array. The index only has 13 bits
            so rules with more than 8192 selectors should be split.

            One of the paths was not splitting the rule: StyleSheetContents::wrapperInsertRule().
            When rules with too many selectors were added, the index would overflow and
            some RuleData would point to selectors in the middle of selector chains. The resulting
            behavior is random based on the selectors and the DOM.

            We cannot easily fix that because the CSS OM API do not expect to create
            several rules in response to calls to the API.
            In this patch, I don't do anything fancy and just let the calls fail
            if we cannot use the rules safely.


            Content Extensions were also running into this problem. Large Selector lists are
            pretty common, and ContentExtensionStyleSheet::addDisplayNoneSelector() was
            overflowing the RuleData, creating broken page.

            Unlike CSSOM, there is no problem with splitting rules coming from Content Extensions.
            Instead of creating new APIs for that case, I rely on the parser to extend the StyleSheetContents.
            That code already knows how to break rules correctly.

            REGRESSION (r172417, r184065): Multiple rendering issues with fixed attached background-image
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147049

            The fixed-attached background-image rendering is special. In general, to
            display it, the destinationSize should be set to visibleContentSize. The
            destinationLocation should be set such that the background-image does
            not move with scrolling. The topContentInset should be subtracted from
            the destinationLocation such that background-image can be rendered blurred
            in the topContentArea. However there are cases in which these rules have to
            be changed.

            -- destinationSize: In the case of fixed layout size, the fixedLayoutSize
            is bigger than the visibleContentSize. In this case, if the background-image
            belongs to the root element, the destinationSize has to be set to fixedLayoutSize.
            Otherwise it has to be set to the borderBoxSize unless the overflow is
            hidden.

            -- destinationLocation: If the background-image belongs to the root element, no
            scroll offset to added to destinationLocation. For non-root element case,
            FrameView::documentScrollOffsetRelativeToViewOrigin() should be used if no page
            scaling is applied. Otherwise FrameView::scrollOffsetForFixedPosition() should be
            used instead.

            Since the thumb is positioned after the layout for the input (shadow) subtree is finished, the repaint rects
            issued during the layout will not cover the re-positioned thumb.
            We need to issue a repaint soon after the thumb is re-positioned.
